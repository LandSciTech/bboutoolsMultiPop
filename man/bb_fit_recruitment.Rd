  data,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.frame.}

\item{adult_female_proportion}{A number between 0 and 1 of the expected proportion of adults that are female.
If NULL, the proportion is estimated from the data (i.e., \code{Cows ~ Binomial(adult_female_proportion, Cows + Bulls)}) and a prior of dbeta(65, 35) is used.
This prior can be changed via the \code{priors} argument.}

\item{sex_ratio}{A number between 0 and 1 of the proportion of females at birth.
This proportion is applied to yearlings.}

\item{min_random_year}{A whole number of the minimum number of years required to fit year as a random effect (as opposed to a fixed effect).}

\item{year_trend}{A flag indicating whether to fit a year trend effect.
Year trend cannot be fit if there is also a fixed year effect (as opposed to random effect).}

\item{year_start}{A whole number between 1 and 12 indicating the start of the caribou (i.e., biological) year. By default, April is set as the start of the caribou year.}

\item{nthin}{A whole number of the thinning rate.}

\item{niters}{A whole number of the number of iterations per chain after thinning and burn-in.}

\item{priors}{A named vector of the parameter prior distribution values.
Any missing values are assigned their default values in \code{priors_survival()} and \code{priors_recruitment()}.
If NULL, all parameters are assigned their default priors.}

\item{quiet}{A flag indicating whether to suppress messages and progress bars.}

\item{multi_pops}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, multiple populations can be analyzed together. It is assumed that the distribution of interannual variability does not differ among populations.}

\item{allow_missing}{Default FALSE. If TRUE allow missing values in data. Set TRUE to get projections for unobserved years from models with random year effects.}

\description{
Fit heirarchical Bayesian recruitment model using Nimble.
}
\details{
If the number of years is > \code{min_random_year}, a fixed-effects model is fit.
Otherwise, a mixed-effects model is fit with random intercept for each year.
If \code{year_trend} is TRUE and the number of years is > \code{min_random_year}, the model
will be fit with year as a continuous effect (i.e. trend) and no fixed effect of year.
If \code{year_trend} is TRUE and the number of years is <= \code{min_random_year}, the model
will be fit with year as a continuous effect and a random intercept for each year.

The start month of the Caribou year can be adjusted with \code{year_start}.
