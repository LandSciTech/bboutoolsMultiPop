# bboutools 1.1.0

- added `bb_predict_calf_cow_ratio_trend()` to mirror `bb_predict_recruitment_trend()` but for calf-cow ratio. 

# bboutools 1.0.0

- cleaned up documentation following JOSS review.
- add Stable lifecycle badge.

# bboutools 0.1.0

- added `rhat` argument to `glance()` and `converged()` to adjust convergence threshold, with default value of 1.05. Convergence no longer depends on `ess`.
- removed `exclude_year` argument in `bb_fit_survival_ml()` as failure to fit fixed year effect resolved with intercept adjustment. 
- provide warning to user if start of caribou year (`year_start`) not matching for survival and recruitment model fits in `bb_predict_growth()`.

# bboutools 0.0.0.9007

- Added `bb_predict_calf_cow_ratio()`
- `bb_predict_recruitment()` now predicts adjusted recruitment, following methods in DeCesare (2012). Previous output of `bb_predict_recruitment()` can now be obtained by running `bb_predict_calf_cow_ratio()`.
- Renamed `yearling_proportion_female` argument in `bb_fit_recruitment()` to `sex_ratio`. This matches `bbouretro` language and arguments in `bb_predict_recruitment()`.
- Changed default value of `include_uncertain_morts` argument in `bb_fit_survival()` to TRUE. This matches default behaviour in `bbouretro`.
- Added article on 'Prior Selection and Influence'.
- Added example to "Analytical Methods" article. 

# bboutools 0.0.0.9006

- Moved internal data checking functions to be exported function in `bboudata`.
- Updated bbtutorial vignette to mention the new data checking functions.

# bboutools 0.0.0.9005

- `bb_fit_recruitment()`  will error if there are any NA values in the PopulationName, Year, Month and Day columns. 
- `bb_fit_survival()` will error if there are any NA values in the PopulationName, Year, Month, StartTotal, MortalitiesCertain and MortalitiesUncertain columns. 

# bboutools 0.0.0.9004

Added 'Getting Started' vignette. 

Added functions:

- `bb_predict_survival_trend()`
- `bb_predict_recruitment_trend()`
- `bb_plot_year_trend_survival()`
- `bb_plot_year_trend_recruitment()`
- `bb_predict_population_change()`
- `bb_plot_year_population_change()`
- `plot()` (plot traceplots for bboufit object)

Added arguments:

- `year_start = 4L` to `bb_fit_survival()` and `bb_fit_recruitment()` to set caribou year start month as integer - (default April)
- `yearling_female_proportion = 0.5` to `bb_fit_recruitment()` to set yearling sex ratio
- `year_trend = FALSE` to `bb_fit_survival()` and `bb_fit_recruitment()` to fit model with year trend
- `include_random_effects = TRUE` to `coef()`/`tidy()` to provide possibility of removing individual random effect estimates

# bboutools 0.0.0.9003

- Switch MCMC engine from Jags to Nimble.
- Added recruitment/survival Maximum Likelihood fit functions:
  - `bb_fit_survival_ml()`
  - `bb_fit_recruitment_ml`
- Added summary methods for Maximum Likelihood output with class 'bboufit_ml'. 
- Changed how priors are passed to fit functions (e.g. `priors = c(b0_mu = 4, b0_sd = 2)` instead of `priors = list(b0 = "dnorm(4, 2^-2)")`). 
- Added argument `sig_fig` to `coef()`/`tidy()`/`predict()` methods to round estimates and lower/upper bounds to set significant figures. 

# bboutools 0.0.0.9002

- `bb_predict_growth()` now handles different years and doesn't return month.
- Adjusted default priors.


# bboutools 0.0.0.9001

- Soft-deprecated `bb_predict_lambda()` for `bb_predict_growth()`.
- Added `bb_plot_year_growth()`.
- Added `bb_plot_year_recruitment()`.
- Added `bb_plot_month_survival()`.
- Added `bb_plot_year_survival()`.
- Added `bb_plot_month()`.


# bboutools 0.0.0.9000

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
